![coverphoto](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60944453/145673995-a98d4ac9-3b63-4111-bcf8-5ed021e12ad6.jpg)

There were many subjects that I experienced and practiced while doing this project. I have mentioned them below. Also, due to the problem with Firebase Deployment, I have edited my hosting as Netlify for now. <br> Currently, due to Firebase Auth problem, it will not be possible to login with sign in. The image above is the one I got from my local project folder (localhost browse page). I'll update here once I fix these two problems.

## Topics

- Compound & Styled Components
- Custom Hooks
- React Context
- React Portals
- Flexbox
- Firebase's Firestore realtime Database
- Firebase Google Authentication
- Responsive Design

### Demo Link

This website is deployed on Netlify. You can view the site here [Click here](https://netflix-clone-reactt.netlify.app/) 



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
